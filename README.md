# Diaree

## Introduction

Diaree is a simple app that allows users to collect, organize, and share external web links and media into a centralized personal or shared folder that can be organised into folders.

We all bookmark things constantly - interesting articles, YouTube videos, podcasts, Instagram posts, whatever catches our eye online. But then what? Those bookmarks just pile up in some forgotten browser folder, or you lose track of that one Reddit thread you swore you'd come back to.

## Why it matters
Imagine you have a bookmarks folder on Instagram. You find an interesting post concerning a topic, then you save it into the folder. On twitter, where you have another bookmarks folder, you save another related post. 
you could have put them together somewehere to access easily, but it's impossible because they're on different apps.

And here's the thing that makes it really useful: you can share your collections. Found a bunch of great resources on a topic? Share that folder with a friend or colleague

With **Diaree*, you can save them both in the same bookamrks folder. Diaree simplifies saving bookmarks. 

You can use it as a multipurpose portable jotter of some sort.

## Who is it for?
It is for everyone who uses the internet, saves stuff and forgets to come back to it because it heaps into a humongous unorganised pile.
